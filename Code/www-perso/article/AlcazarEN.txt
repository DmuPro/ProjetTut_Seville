The Alcazar and its gardens are no less representative than the Cathedral of the essential phases of Seville's history. This fortress-palace was built in 712 by the Arab conquerors to control the Guadalquivir and preserves a crenellated Almohad period enclosure, as well as several interior spaces dating from before the Reconquest (Patio de las Muñecas, Patio del Yeso).
After 1248, it became the royal residence and was redeveloped during the reign of Peter the Cruel (1350-1369): the palace built inside the Alcazar from 1364 to 1366 illustrates the syncretism inherent in the art of Mudéjar, which borrows its techniques and decorative vocabulary from the Arab art of Andalusia.
More than any other space and despite the over-reporting suffered in the 16th century, the Patio de las Doncellas (Ladies' Patio) is evocative of a captivating aesthetic that survived Christianization with finely crafted stuccoes, artesonados ceilings, azulejos in the galleries, the deaf fountain in the centre of the courtyard.

<p>
The works undertaken from the 15th to the 17th centuries partially respected the palace of Peter the Cruel (of which the Ambassadors' Lounge is a prestigious witness) and above all the general provisions of the Alcazar and its gardens: if each century has imposed its mark on the decoration of apartments, fountains or pavilions, the refined tradition of an Andalusian palace has remained intact.
</p>
<p>
The Seville Alcazar bears an exceptional testimony to the Almohad civilization and Christian Andalusia, all imbued with Moorish influences from the reconquest of 1248 to the 16th century.

It is directly and materially associated to an event of universal significance: Columbus' discovery of the New World in 1492-1493.
