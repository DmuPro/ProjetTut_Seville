The Giralda was sponsored by Abu Yaqub Yusuf in 1184. The work was completed in 1198.
It is the former minaret of the Great Mosque built from 1172 to 1198 by Amir Yaqub al-Mansur, which competes in size and elegance of decoration with the Koutoubia of Marrakech and the Hassan Tower of Rabat, the other two major monuments of the time. It is crowned by four superimposed copper spheres of decreasing diameter from bottom to top. La Giralda was one of the most sumptuous and admired monuments in Al Andalus. It constitutes a
unique artistic achievement, a masterpiece of Almohad architecture. Become a bell tower after the reconquest of Seville (1248), the minaret escaped destruction and was crowned in the 16th century by the bronze statue of the Faith which acts as a weather vane (Giraldillo) at 97.52m altitude.
Only a few modifications made during the 19th century changed the appearance of the building, notably the removal of some Almohad decorations.
La Giralda was registered as a Spanish National Heritage Site in 1928 and was included on the World Heritage List in 1987.

<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>
The architect of the Giralda designed a square tower 13.61 meters wide, using stones from Roman monuments for the foundations and the lower part of the tower. The rest is built in brick, as is often the case in Almohad architecture. In reality, these are two interlocking towers: a smaller side tower is part of the larger square of the outer tower. The space between the two structures is occupied by a square staircase, consisting of a succession of 35 straight ramps on a gentle slope, to access the upper terrace.

The Giralda has a total of 24 bells. Among these bells, the 6 largest are fixed and invisible from the outside, hung on the wall of the terrace. Among them are the two large historical bells "Santa Maria La Mayor" (the bumblebee) and "San Miguel", dating from 1588 and 1792, which are located on the eastern and western sides, as well as four additional bells dating from 1438, 1500, 1599 and 1764.

<p>
The other 18 bells are fixed in the opening windows of the terrace. The North and South faces have 5 each, the East and West faces have 4 each. These bells date from different periods, the last ones were added in 1992 and 1998 bringing the total number of flight bells to 18.
</p>
<p>
These 18 bells ring in "rotating flight" (the bells make a complete turn) as is customary in Spain. The ringing of all these bells (the "plenum", sounded on the occasion of major religious holidays), is particularly impressive.

<p>
With all the added elements, the tower rises to 104.1 metres.
