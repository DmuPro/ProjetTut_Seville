To control trade with the American colonies, Philip II decided to build a new "Casa de Contratacion" whose plans were executed by Juan de Herrera, his favourite architect. 
This "stock exchange" was to succeed a similar establishment, installed since 1503 in the outbuildings of the Alcazar. The palace designed by Herrera rose, in a severe style favoured by the architect of 
l'Escorial, from 1583 to 1598 but, even after the last works of 1649, the "Casa de Contratacion" never occupied the planned seat. After various temporary assignments, Lonja became in 1784 
the Archivo general de Indias and has housed since 1790 all the historical and diplomatic collections relating to the American colonies.

<p>
The General Archives of India (in Spanish: Archivo General de Indias) were born in 1785 from the desire of Charles III of Spain to centralize in a single place the documents 
relating to the Spanish colonies, probably with the ulterior motive of encouraging the writing of a history of colonization that contradicts the black legend spread on this subject in several European countries, 
for example in France with the History of the Two Indies of Father Raynal. These collections were previously divided between the General Archives of Simancas, close to saturation, Cadiz and Seville. 
José de Galvez y Gallardo, Secretary of India, was in charge of carrying out the project, with the help of the historian Juan Bautista Muñoz, India's first cosmographer.
The Casa Lonja de Mercaderes in Seville, built under the reign of Philip II between 1584 and 1598 by Juan de Mijares on Juan de Herrera's plans, was chosen to house the new institution.

In October 1785, the first documents arrived from Simancas. The date 1760 was chosen as a separation between what would be sent to Seville to be kept there 
and what would remain in the administrations as current archives.
</p>
<p>
The archives occupy more than nine linear kilometers. The most important funds in terms of volume are those of the Council of India, the Casa de Contratación and the Secretariats of State that have had to deal with, 
from XVIII, colonial affairs, the Royal Company of Havana and the Overseas Chamber of the Court of Accounts. Only a few documents come directly from colonial organizations 
(General Captain's Office of Cuba (18th-19th centuries) repatriated following the Spanish-American War) or individuals who played a role in the colonial administration, such as the Duke of Veragua,
a direct descendant of Christopher Columbus, General Polivieja, one of the last captains general of the Philippines or the viceroy of Peru Abascal. The General Archives of India owns the archive holdings
on the political, economic, cultural and social history of the former Spanish colonial empire. They keep autographs of Christopher Columbus, Magellan, Vasco Nunez de Balboa,
of Pizarro and Cortés.
</p>

<p>
The Lonja is directly and materially associated with an event of universal importance: Christopher Columbus' discovery of the New World in 1492-1493.
It has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.

The building stands free and on a series of steps to overcome the unevenness of the land, chosen next to the old Jewish quarter, between the cathedral and the walls of the Alcazar. 
Its plan is practically square, housing a superb monumental court where Doric and Ionic half-columns are superimposed, as in the "Cloister of Evangelists" of the Monastery of the Escorial, 
designed by Herrera himself, and with which Lonja sevillana has some similarities.
Behind the courtyard windows are large galleries. Those on the upper floor are covered with vaulted roofs decorated with geometric cassettes and reliefs, very typical of the Renaissance style 
and sober, of great decorative value, separated by semi-circular arched sections. On its sides are high shelves carved in noble wood.
