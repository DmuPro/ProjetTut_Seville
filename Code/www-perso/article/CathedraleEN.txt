<h3>Construction and history</h3>


<h4>The Almohad mosque (1172–1248)</h4>

<p>
The mosque was built by a Morrocan Muslim berbers movement founded in the 12th century.
Caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf built a new mosque in 1172 south of the city. The new mosque was consecrated in 1182 but the construction was not finished until 1198.
It replaces the one built between 829 and 830 by Umar Ibn Adabbas.
Being closer to the city of Alcazar, the mosque was designed by a renowned architect "Ahmad ben Basso".
The building has an area of more than 15,000 m² including the courtyard and minarets.
The prayer hall, unlike the old mosque, has the same characteristics as the mosques of Al Andalus:
The 17 south-facing corridors that are perpendicular to the qibla wall.
In the splendid days of Arab rule decided to build the mosque "al-Moharrem" (Sacred) between 1172 and 1198, in order to complete the long process of building the southern part of Seville.
</p>

<h4>The Christianized mosque (1248–1434)</h4>
<p>
Shortly after the conquest of Seville by Ferdinand II, the Abu Yaqub Yusuf Mosque was converted into a Christian cathedral.
The interior is divided into different chapels by building walls in the bays along the north and south walls.
Almost half of the eastern part of the cathedral was occupied by the royal chapels that cared for the bodies of Ferdinand, his wife and Alfonso.
In 1420, one of the largest international building sites of the 15th century was opened in Seville, where the most illustrious Spanish, Flemish and German architects and sculptors succeeded each other.
</p>

<h4>The Gothic cathedral (1434–1506, 1511–1517)</h4>
<p>
The Cathedral of Seville was built to show the richness of the city, it then became an important centre of exchange after the Reconquista which took place in 1248.
In July 1401 the city leaders decided to build a new cathedral to replace the large mosque that had served as a cathedral until then.
According to local traditions, the members of the canons' chapter would have said "Hagamos una Iglesia tan hermosa y tan grandiosa que los que la vieren labrada nos tengan por locos"
("Let us build a church so pretty and big that when it is finished, the people who see it will think we are crazy")
</p>
<p>
The actual entry of July 8, 1401, recorded among others by Juan Cean Bermuda in 1801 but now lost, proposed the following construction: "una tal y tan buena, que no haya otra su igual" ("One so well that none of them could reach the ankle") 
Construction continued until 1506 when Parish clergy offered half of their allowances to pay architects, stained glass artists, masons, sculptors, craftsmen and labourers and other types of expenses.
Several factors such as royal resistance or the temporary relocation of the royal chapel delayed construction until 1434.
This year, King John II of Castile authorizes the movement of royal bodies (deceased bodies of the royal family) to the cathedral's cloister for storage
</p>
<p>
5 years after the end of the construction in 1511, the crossing lanterns or cimborrio collapsed and the construction began again.
In 1888 the intercept collapsed again, construction was resumed until 1903.
</p>
<p>
The demolition of the old mosque and the construction of a new Gothic Cathedral began in 1401 and was completed around 1530.
</p>
<p>
Seville's prosperity after the discovery of the New World further strengthened the considerable financial resources used to build and beautify the Cathedral, which in the 16th century received an incomparable set of stained glass windows, altarpieces, grids and stalls.

<h4>17th century</h4>
<p>
In the 17th century, the Cathedral still received very rich donations, covered with baroque sculptures and paintings of the greats Sevillian painters Murillo and Valdes Leal.

<h3>Some Informations</h3>
<p>
The Gothic church is the largest in Europe. It is divided into five naves, of very high height, composition and construction united, surrounded by chapels. The vaults are very simple warheads, except in the transept. The numerous stained glass windows, magnificent from the Middle Ages and in Renaissance style, stand out on the walls.

<p>
Of the nine doors that give access to the Cathedral, those that are the least interesting from an artistic point of view are the portals with notable reliefs of the tympanums and sculptures of angels and prophets.

It is devoid of cai "girola", leaning against the head of the temple, is the Royal Chapel.
The outbuildings on the south side are those of the Chapter Hall ("Cabildo") and those of the two sacristies, in Renaissance style. While the current offices date back to the first years of the 20th century.
The cloister is a vast "courtyard" (sahn) of a large Almohad mosque to which the Giralda belonged, the lower part of which is Arabic. The bell tower dates from the Renaissance; this tower is 91.70 m high.
The Parish of the Cathedral or Tabernacle ("Parroquia del Sagrario") is located on the western side of the "Patio de los Naranjos". It is a temple with a single nave, which has one of the chapels between the buttresses and whose overall dimensions form a perfect rectangle.
The Cathedral is directly and materially associated to an event of universal significance: Columbus' discovery of the New World in 1492-1493.
</p
<p>
From this period are: the Sacristy of the "Calices", the Major Sacristy, the Royal Chapel, the "house of accounts", the Chapter Hall.
The style of these dependencies varies from plateresque to mannerism.
It is in the Cathedral that the tomb of Christopher Colombus is located. It's in the Hall of Admirals 
that were prepared for some of the greatest explorations, including the circumnavigation of the world by Magellan and S. del Cano (1519-1522).
</p>
<p>
The Cathedral, one of the largest and most ornate religious buildings in the world, summarizes in its complex structure the vicissitudes of a troubled history: it incorporates into the chapel of  Granada some visigothic capitals, the last remains of the primitive cathedral that the Arab conquest of 712 condemned to destruction; but it is above all one of the major witnesses of the Almohad apogee.

<h4>Justification for inscription on the World Heritage List</h4>

<p>
The main cultural characteristics of the Cathedral are:
</p>
<p>
1)It is the largest Gothic building in Europe, the passage of centuries has accumulated magnificent masterpieces of art, reflecting seven hundred years of Andalusian culture.
</p>
<p>
2) There are still very important parts of the most important mosque in Western Islam, such as the tower, which was the highest and largest of the Muslim minarets.
</p>
<p>
3) The Renaissance works embrace Europe's first elliptical space (Cabildo), which consecrated (with the Giralda) Hernan Ruiz, one of the most important architects of the 16th century.
</p>
<p>
4) The architectural solutions that have necessarily reached the entire Cathedral have allowed us to get to know other figures in Spanish and South American architecture.
